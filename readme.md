# BadgeR

Managing organization members, their qualifications, team rosters, and identification is easy with **Badge Reconciliation** (_BadgeR_). 

# Functionality 

_Super Administrators_ create organizations and assign _Administrators_ to those organizations.  

_Administrators_ create organization members, teams, and abilities.  

_Teams_ are organization members, grouped by abilities or on the fly.  

_Abilities_ denote what an organization member is capable of, such as 'Firefighting', or 'Amateur Radio'. Teams can be set to require one or more abilities for membership.  

_Organization Members_ are the actual people. They can be assigned abilities and grouped into teams.  

# Badges

The core of BadgeR is the ability to produce PDFs for use in printing ID badges for organization members and teams. The front (first page) of the PDF is the typical ID badge format, with various identifying information (picture, name, organization name, etc). The back (second page) of the PDF will contain "return if found" instructions and a QR code.  

The QR code will be a URL linking to the organization member's page on BadgeR. If the ID card is expired, a large,red banner will display at the top of the page reflecting that. Otherwise, the page will show all the information on the ID card. This way, an ID card can be validated by anyone with a QR code scanner on their, without having to be tied into the organization's credential database.
